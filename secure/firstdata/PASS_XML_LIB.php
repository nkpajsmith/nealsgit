# PASS_XML_LIB.php - example of how to send and recieve an XML string
#
# In this sample, the merchant would be doing their own XML encoding/decoding
#
# This sample demonstrates bypassing the LPHP.PHP module that is used
# by most of the LinkPoint PHP samples, and sending an XML string DIRECTLY 
# to the shared library LIBLPHP.SO which then uses LIBLPSSL.SO to communicate
# with LSGS. 
#
# An appropriate use of this code would be in a PHP installation where the 
# merchant wants to do their own XML encoding/decoding and the server's PHP
# installation does not support the built-in CURL methods.
#
# This sample does only a minimal SALE transaction, but it can be
# used as an example of passing in larger XML strings for more complex
# transactions. Any of the included LinkPoint XML sample files could be 
# passed in as an XML string here.
